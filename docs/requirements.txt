Frictionless Requirements: Startup Pitch and Investor Platform

Overview
Frictionless is a streamlined investor-startup ecosystem for frictionless collaboration. Frictionless is a dual-sided marketplace designed to empower both startups and investors. It enables founders to showcase their companies, demonstrate investment readiness, and connect with aligned capital sources — while providing investors with the tools to discover, track, and engage with high-potential startups that match their thesis and timing.

The platform facilitates informed, transparent interactions on both sides by surfacing actionable insights, readiness metrics, and structured engagement workflows.

Startup Funding, Reimagined — Instant Alignment for Founders and Investors. Matched. Measured. Monitored.




Goals of Application
The Frictionless platform is designed to serve three primary user types — investors, startups, and admins — each with distinct goals:
Investors - gain structured visibility into startup pipelines, track "watchlist" founders, and make data-informed decisions aligned with their investment theses.
Startups - gain exposure to qualified investors, track engagement, and receive structured feedback on investment readiness.
Admins - ensure the integrity, configuration, and moderation of the platform experience.

Admin – MVP Functionality 
1. User Account Oversight
•	View and manage all user accounts (startups and investors)
•	Support account-level changes:
•	Suspend/reactivate/delete users
•	Assist with onboarding or access recovery
•	Troubleshoot login/authentication issues
•	View account metadata, documents, and interaction logs


Note: Privacy and data exposure controls are not managed by Admins directly. Instead, all users manage their own visibility through their Privacy & Exposure Dashboard.


2. Supervision of Privacy & Sharing Logic
While users control their sharing preferences, Admins can:
•	Monitor sharing status (public, semi-private, private) of profiles for operational visibility
•	View audit trails (e.g. sharing toggles, exposure events)
•	Support users in configuring their Privacy & Exposure Dashboard if requested
•	Configure default sharing settings only for white-label enterprise instances
Example: A white-label partner may have all inbound startup submissions marked “private by default” — Admins configure that instance-level behavior at setup.


3. Assessment Engine Management
•	Define and maintain the Frictionless Readiness Assessment logic
•	Create or update:
•	Assessment questions
•	Grading rubrics
•	Sector-specific scoring logic
•	Link assessments to the AI data extraction pipeline from pitch decks, websites, and social signals
•	Trigger system-wide reassessments when scoring models change


4. AI Data & Profile Quality Oversight
•	Audit AI-extracted profiles for accuracy
•	Flag hallucinated, missing, or low-confidence data
•	Escalate or correct incorrect inferences from:
•	Pitch decks
•	Investor decks
•	Website and social scraping
•	Optionally approve AI-generated updates before public display (for high-risk users or premium partners)


5. Platform Directory & Discovery Supervision
•	Browse the global directories of both startups and investors
•	Apply filters:
•	Sector, Stage, Geography, Investment Focus
•	CAP, ARR, Burn, Runway, Profit...

2. Future functionality not part of MVP build
Full reporting and analytics
Audit logs for all user activity
A map view to see investors/startups
Community features for in-app connection and communication between different startup companies and investors
3. Progressive Web App Only
MVP will be accessible on desktop and mobile browsers
Mobile apps are not part of the MVP but might be revisited in the future


Non-Functional Requirements
Maintainability: Code should be modular and well-documented to facilitate future updates
Automated Tests:
Core functionality should have automated tests in order to prevent regressions
Unit tests and integration tests should both be written for most critical workflows
Performance: Ensure fast load times (<3 seconds) and scalability for growing user bases
Security:
Secure authentication (e.g., OAuth2)
Data encryption in transit


Technical Stack
Frontend
This framework should be something that is “modern” (e.g., React, Tailwind, Next.js, Vue.js)

Should employ low-lift PWA technologies like
All Browser compliance
Installable app
Responsive for different screen sizes (with just two breakpoints: mobile and desktop)
Takes into consideration Search Engine Optimization
Service Workers for speed/offline access

Backend
Preferred: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, APIs)
Alternatives: Open for discussion if Supabase does not meet specific needs
Hosting
Supabase should be hosted by Supabase on the free plan
The front end and other assets should be deployed in a CDN like AWS CloudFront for fast access
Alternatives: Open for discussion if AWS does not meet specific needs or if there is an easier/cheaper alternative for front-end hosting
The main geography for the MVP will be North and South America (US, Mexico, Latin America) 
Two cloud environments should be created for the front-end and backend: production and staging
Code should be checked into a private Github repo (available upon request)
Basic CI/CD pipelines should be setup in Github for deployment to Supabase/AWS after pull request


Milestones
Between each milestone listed below, the team should validate progress and decisions with the Frictionless CTO (Rich Robison) before moving on in order to provide feedback at the right stage.

Finalize technical stack and architecture design
Create database design and Supabase backend
Create cloud architecture and deployment pipelines
Develop frontend features
Conduct testing cycles for usability and performance
Do acceptance testing with other members of Frictionless (CEO, CPO,  COO, etc)
Signoff and finalize project engagement

Detailed mockups can be found in Frictionless.fig


Additional Features to Scope Out for the future

These additional features will also be requested depending on the timing and cost, but are not part of the base MVP requested in this document. 

1. Virtual Data Room 
A Virtual Data Room would allow startups to securely submit sensitive materials such as financial documents, business plans, and proprietary information. Key features to consider include:

Enhanced Security: Two-factor authentication, granular access controls, dynamic watermarking, and AES-256 encryption.
Collaboration Tools: Real-time commenting and document sharing for investors and startups.
Compliance: Ensure adherence to industry standards like ISO or FINRA for data protection.

2. Web Scraper for Startup Data
A web scraper would automate the collection of data on early-stage companies, including funding rounds, valuations, sectors, and investor profiles. Features to include:

Data Points: Funding history, valuation trends, sector performance, investor activity.
Tools: SaaS platforms (e.g., Octoparse), open-source frameworks (e.g., Beautiful Soup or Scrapy), or custom Python-based solutions.

3. LLM inference of company data points from pitch deck
In order to assess the startup’s investment readiness, we gather sever points of data like:  Frictionless Assessment

We would like to price out the cost of getting an LLM to produce this data from a pitch deck with low hallucinations.


4. Built in form for startups to take for startup readiness
The LLM likely won’t get all the data need, so we also need to evaluate having in-app experience for asking these questions to fill out their profile.

5. White Label version of the site to be embedded on investor sites

Purpose
The White Label/Direct version of Frictionless enables venture capital firms and investors to host a customized entry point on their own websites for startup founders to submit pitch decks and engage with their branded investment experience. This allows VCs to maintain their brand identity while still leveraging the full power of the Frictionless platform.
Key Concepts
White Label = "Direct" experience on visuals and backend tagging


User interaction is on a venture firm's website, not on FrictionlessInc.com


Creates a branded funnel for startup pitch intake


Automatically connects to the Frictionless investor’s account and tags entries as "Direct"


Full functionality once inside Frictionless remains consistent


How It Works: User Flow
1. Entry Point: VC Website
A VC firm embeds or links to a white-labeled version of the pitch submission form on their own website.


Founders see the VC’s brand (logo, colors) and are encouraged to submit a pitch.


Submission form collects standard Frictionless startup profile data and documents.


2. Connection to Frictionless Core Platform
Once a pitch is submitted:


The data is stored and routed through Frictionless backend infrastructure.


The startup is automatically tagged as a “Direct” lead in the system.


The associated investor sees this startup under the "Direct Applications" toggle in their Frictionless dashboard.


3. Onboarding & Assessment
Founders are prompted to complete the Frictionless startup readiness assessment on the Frictionle.


Startups receive limited access to the Frictionless platform for ongoing engagement with the investor and progress tracking.


System Requirements for Implementation
Front-End (VC Website Embed or Link)
Customizable submission form widget (logo, color, custom URL routing)


Optional integration as an iframe, pop-up modal, or standalone page hosted by Frictionless but co-branded


Back-End
Tagging mechanism: Automatically classify and display startups as “Direct” in the system


White label theming engine: Serve the correct branding for different partners


Routing logic to associate each submission with the correct investor profile


Seamless integration with startup readiness assessment and messaging workflows


Admin Needs
Ability for admins to configure and deploy white label instances per investor


Dashboard to view/manage "Direct" entries across accounts
