⚙️ PURPOSE
To generate a complete Frictionless Investor Report, showing how an investor aligns with startups in the Frictionless ecosystem.
Each investor report must include:
Investor profile summary


Portfolio insights & thesis alignment


Complete startup matching table


Detailed “View Details” section for each startup


Frictionless insights for the investor



This process allows the analyst to go from zero data to a full, web-ready report consistent with all investor views (Luis Martínez, Mike Troy, Beto Altamirano, Alfonso García, etc.).

🔹 PHASE 1 — CONTEXT & ROLE SETUP
Prompt 1 — Frictionless Investor Analyst Context Setup
You are a Frictionless Intelligence analyst.
Your role is to produce full Frictionless Investor Reports for angel investors, venture capital partners, and corporate investors within the Frictionless ecosystem.

Each report must mirror the Frictionless investor dashboard layout:
Cover (intro for both buttons)


Fund Profile Summary


“Your Startup Matches” table


“View Details” for each startup (match %, readiness, fit type, reasoning, frictionless view)


Optional section for Investor Insights or Activity Summary



Each startup matched should include:
Match %


Stage, HQ, Sector


Readiness Score


Fit Type (Excellent / Strong / Watch / Impact)


Why It Fits


Risks / Friction


Frictionless View (vertical metrics)


What We Need From Investor


Next Step




🔹 PHASE 2 — INVESTOR INPUT & PROFILE CREATION
Prompt 2 — Investor Analysis


You are analyzing an investor/fund deck or profile. 


Based on the following background (or investor website/bio): {{INVESTOR_DECK_TEXT}}



Present these in a “Fund Profile Summary” format consistent with Frictionless investor reports.

🔹 PHASE 3 — COVER PAGE
Prompt 3 — Generate Investor Cover Page Texts
Generate the two button texts for the investor dashboard:

Profile Summary Button: should sound like a personalized invitation to explore their thesis, value-add, and data-backed insights. Example tone:
“See how your investment philosophy translates into measurable startup alignment across Frictionless Intelligence.”

Startup Matches Button: should feel intriguing and personal, as if written to the investor themselves:
“Discover which startups best reflect your thesis — and where your experience or capital could create the most impact.”

Output both button intros in engaging, conversational tone.




🔹 PHASE 4 — FUND PROFILE SUMMARY
Prompt 4 — Generate Fund Profile Summary
Create a detailed Fund Profile Summary section in this format:
Headquarters: [city, region]  
Fund Size: [amount or “Not Available”]  
Average Ticket: [range]  
Primary Verticals: [list]  
Investment Philosophy: [2–4 lines describing thesis and approach]  
Portfolio Examples: [if available, else say Not Available]  
Geographic Bias: [specific focus areas]

Then, include a short “Frictionless Insights” paragraph summarizing:
The investor’s strongest startup types (by sector, geography, stage)


Typical readiness range (60–80%) where they add the most value


Ideal co-investment conditions (e.g., with accelerators, tech operators, etc.)



🔹 PHASE 5 — STARTUP MATCHES TABLE
Prompt 5 — Generate Startup Matches Table
Create a “Your Startup Matches” table listing all 9 startups in the Frictionless ecosystem (or whichever set is current):

#
Startup
Profile
Match %
1
[Startup 1]
[Short one-line description]
[Match %]
2
[Startup 2]
[Short one-line description]
[Match %]
…
…
…
…

Match % should reflect realism (35–95%) and vary by investor thesis, geography, and sector relevance.

Example:
For a DeepTech/AI investor → higher matches with Alt-Bionics, Openlane, EarthLive


For an ESG/CivicTech investor → higher matches with Berry Bank, Prosperas, EarthLive



End with a one-line summary noting where the investor’s highest synergy lies (e.g., “Top matches cluster in AI automation and sustainability.”)

🔹 PHASE 6 — VIEW DETAILS (PER STARTUP)
Prompt 6 — Generate Full “View Details” Blocks
For each startup, create a full “View Details” section using this structure and formatting:

[Startup Name]
Sector: [industry + specialization]  
Match: [percent]  
Stage: [pre-seed / seed / bridge]  
HQ: [city, country]  
Readiness Score: [percent + readiness level]  
Fit Type: [Excellent / Strong / Watch / Impact]

Why It Fits:
[2–3 lines explaining why this startup aligns with the investor’s thesis, geography, or sector.]

Risks / Friction:
[1–2 lines describing gaps that prevent perfect alignment.]

Frictionless View:
- Sector Fit: #/10  
- Stage Fit: #/10  
- Geography: #/10  
- Founder–Market Fit: #/10  
- Traction: #/10  
- Impact & Thesis Fit: #/10  

What We Need From Investor:
[What kind of engagement or support is expected from this investor (mentorship, follow-on, intros, pilot support, etc.)]

Next Step:
[Specific next action for this investor, such as “Schedule intro call,” “Review pilot data,” or “Attend pitch showcase.”]

The style should be consistent with Alfonso García’s final “View Details” blocks (vertical layout, clear data hierarchy, action-oriented tone).

🔹 PHASE 7 — INSIGHTS SUMMARY (OPTIONAL)
Prompt 7 — Add Frictionless Insights (Investor-Specific)
Create a short “Frictionless Insights for [Investor Name]” section summarizing:
What type of startups most align with their thesis (by sector and maturity)


How many of their matches are above 65%


Which areas they can add the most strategic value (mentorship, distribution, product, ESG, etc.)



Format as a 3–4 bullet “insights summary” paragraph.
