# AI Integration - Pitch Deck & Investor Deck Analysis

## Overview

Both startup and investor onboarding flows now include AI-powered deck analysis using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model with comprehensive Frictionless Intelligence prompts.

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Flow

**Startup Flow:**
```
Startup uploads pitch deck PDF → Supabase Storage → Extract text → Send to /api/analyze-pitch-deck → Store results
```

**Investor Flow:**
```
Investor uploads deck PDF → Supabase Storage → Extract text → Send to /api/analyze-investor-deck → Store results
```

### 2. API Endpoints

**`/api/analyze-pitch-deck`** (POST)
- Accepts startup pitch deck content and filename
- Uses GPT-4o-mini with Frictionless startup analyzer prompt
- Returns structured JSON with comprehensive startup data

**`/api/analyze-investor-deck`** (POST)
- Accepts investor deck/profile content and filename
- Uses GPT-4o-mini with Frictionless investor analyzer prompt
- Returns structured JSON with investor thesis and criteria

### 3. Data Extracted

#### Startup Pitch Deck Analysis

The AI extracts comprehensive information using the Frictionless Intelligence Report format:

**Company Overview:**
- Company name
- Industry (e.g., "FinTech/Alternative Lending/AI")
- Stage (Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, etc.)
- Headquarters location
- Funding ask amount and structure
- Business model
- Value proposition

**Market & Competition:**
- Target market segments
- Market size and growth metrics
- Competitive landscape (competitor names)
- Key differentiators
- Key challenges

**Team:**
- Team size
- Team members (name, role, background)

**Financial Metrics:**
- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- Annual revenue
- Burn rate
- Runway months
- Total raised to date
- Current valuation

**Traction & Product:**
- Traction metrics (users, growth rates, partnerships)
- Product status (MVP, Live, Scaling)
- Geographic focus markets
- Use of funds

**Strategic Analysis:**
- Recommendations (action, area, impact)
- Strategic insights

**Readiness Assessment (0-100 scoring):**
Using Frictionless weighting model:
- Overall score (weighted average)
- Foundational setup (10%)
- Team readiness (20%)
- Funding strategy (15%)
- Financial health (15%)
- Product readiness (15%)
- Tech maturity (15%)
- Go-to-market readiness (25%)
- Storytelling & communication
- Market positioning

#### Investor Deck Analysis

The AI extracts investor profile information:

**Fund Profile:**
- Fund name
- Investor name (for individual angels)
- Headquarters location
- Fund size (e.g., "$50M" or "Angel Investor")
- Average ticket size (e.g., "$25K-$150K")

**Investment Focus:**
- Stage focus (array: Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, etc.)
- Sector focus (array of industries)
- Geography focus (array of regions)
- Investment thesis (detailed philosophy)

**Portfolio & Process:**
- Portfolio highlights (company names)
- Investment criteria:
  - Minimum revenue requirements
  - Team requirements
  - Other requirements
- Value add (how they help portfolio companies)
- Decision process
- Timeline (typical decision timeline)

**Frictionless Insights:**
- Strongest startup types (sectors/geographies/stages)
- Readiness range (typical scores they target)
- Ideal co-investment conditions

### 4. Automatic Profile Creation

#### Startup Profiles

Extracted data automatically populates:
- `startup_profiles.company_name` - From analysis.company_name
- `startup_profiles.sector` - From analysis.industry
- `startup_profiles.stage` - From analysis.stage
- `startup_profiles.description` - From analysis.value_proposition or analysis.business_model
- `startup_profiles.readiness_score` - From analysis.readiness_assessment.overall_score

#### Investor Profiles

Extracted data automatically populates:
- `investor_profiles.organization_name` - From analysis.fund_name
- `investor_profiles.focus_sectors` - From analysis.sector_focus array
- `investor_profiles.focus_stages` - From analysis.stage_focus array

The comprehensive analysis data can be stored separately for full reporting, investor matching, and dashboard features.

## Current Implementation

### Startup Onboarding
- ✅ Upload pitch deck (PDF, PPT, PPTX)
- ✅ Auto-extract text from PDF
- ✅ Send to OpenAI for analysis
- ✅ Store results in database
- ✅ Auto-populate profile fields
- ✅ Calculate readiness score

### Limitations
- PDF text extraction is basic (reads as text)
- For production, consider using proper PDF parser
- PPT/PPTX files uploaded but not yet analyzed (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Better PDF Parsing
```bash
npm install pdf-parse
```

Then use in the frontend or a server endpoint:
```typescript
import pdfParse from 'pdf-parse';

const pdfData = await pdfParse(buffer);
const text = pdfData.text;
```

### 2. PPT/PPTX Support
- Extract slides from PowerPoint files
- Parse text, images, charts
- Analyze visual elements

### 3. Enhanced Analysis
- Extract logo and images
- Analyze charts and graphs
- Identify missing critical information
- Generate recommendations

### 4. Caching
- Cache analysis results
- Avoid re-analyzing same deck
- Store in database for reference

### 5. Batch Processing
- Queue multiple decks
- Background processing
- Progress updates

## Error Handling

The AI analysis is **non-blocking**:
- If analysis fails, onboarding continues
- User can still complete signup
- Profile created with manual data
- Analysis can be retried later

## Cost Considerations

### GPT-4o-mini Pricing
- ~$0.15 per 1M input tokens
- ~$0.60 per 1M output tokens
- Average pitch deck: ~5,000 tokens
- Cost per analysis: ~$0.001-0.003

### Recommendations
- Cache results to avoid re-analysis
- Use for serious inquiries only
- Consider rate limiting
- Monitor usage in OpenAI dashboard

## Testing

### Test the API Directly

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/analyze-pitch-deck \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Your pitch deck text here...",
    "fileName": "test.pdf"
  }'
```

### Test in App

1. Sign up as startup
2. Complete company info
3. Upload PDF pitch deck
4. Click "Complete Setup"
5. Check console for analysis results
6. Verify data in Supabase

## Monitoring

### Check OpenAI Usage
- Dashboard: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Monitor token usage
- Set spending limits

### Check Logs
```bash
# In terminal running npm run dev
# Look for "Analyzing pitch deck..." logs
```

### Check Database
```sql
SELECT
  company_name,
  sector,
  stage,
  readiness_score,
  description
FROM startup_profiles
WHERE readiness_score IS NOT NULL;
```

## Security

### API Key Protection
- ✅ Key stored in environment variable
- ✅ Never exposed to client
- ✅ Only used in API route (server-side)

### Input Validation
- ✅ File size limits (50MB)
- ✅ File type validation (PDF, PPT, PPTX)
- ✅ Content sanitization

### Rate Limiting (TODO)
Consider adding:
```typescript
// In API route
const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({
  max: 10, // 10 requests
  windowMs: 60000, // per minute
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### AI Analysis Not Working

1. **Check OpenAI Key**
   ```bash
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
   # Should show sk-...
   ```

2. **Check API Route**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/analyze-pitch-deck
   # Should return 400 (no content provided)
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for API errors
   - Check network tab for 500 errors

4. **Check Server Logs**
   - Terminal running `npm run dev`
   - Look for OpenAI errors

### Common Errors

**"OpenAI API key not found"**
- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env.local`
- Restart dev server

**"Failed to fetch"**
- Check API route exists: `src/app/api/analyze-pitch-deck/route.ts`
- Verify server is running
- Check for TypeScript errors

**"PDF parsing failed"**
- Current implementation is basic
- Consider using `pdf-parse` library
- May need server-side processing

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- Test with real pitch deck PDFs
- Verify data saves correctly
- Check readiness score calculation

### Short Term
- Add proper PDF parsing library
- Support PPT/PPTX analysis
- Add progress indicator during analysis

### Long Term
- Build admin review interface
- Allow manual corrections
- Generate investor-ready reports
- Match startups with investors based on extracted data
