## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Build Warnings Are Expected
The npm warnings during install are **safe to ignore**:
- They're from sub-dependencies (not your direct dependencies)
- ESLint 8 is deprecated but still required by Next.js 14
- No functionality is affected
- See `BUILD_WARNINGS.md` for full explanation

### Browser Cache Issue (If You See It)
If signup fails with `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`:
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Unregister all service workers (DevTools ‚Üí Application)
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Close and reopen browser
See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for details

### Database Setup Required
Before the app works fully, you must:
1. Run SQL from `DEPLOYMENT.md` in Supabase
2. Create storage buckets (pitch-decks, investor-decks)
3. Configure storage policies
See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for step-by-step instructions

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Testing)
1. **Setup Supabase database**
   - Copy SQL from `DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Create storage buckets

2. **Test locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3001
   ```

3. **Clear browser cache** (if needed)
   - See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for instructions

### For Deployment
1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Frictionless MVP"
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Import repository on Vercel
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy

3. **Update Supabase URLs**
   - Add production domain to allowed URLs
   - Update redirect URLs

### For Production Launch
1. Run accessibility audit
2. Test on multiple browsers & devices
3. Set up error monitoring (Sentry)
4. Configure analytics
5. Test with real users
